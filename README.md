# Create MyUI Card

This is the University of Idaho's scaffold for creating a new Card for the MyUI platform.

It's a simple project boilerplate that includes the following:

 - [Ellucian Experience Design System](https://path-designsystem.elluciancloud.com/#/)
 - [React](https://reactjs.org/)
 - [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)
 - [Mock Service Worker](https://mswjs.io/)
 - [Tanstack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest)
 - [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
 - [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

The CICD pipeline is configured to create a release and publish to NPM when a new tag is created.
